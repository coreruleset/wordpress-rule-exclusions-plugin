# OWASP CRS Plugin
# Plugin name: wordpress-rule-exclusions
# Plugin description: 
# Rule ID block base: 9,507,000 - 9,507,999
# Plugin version: 1.0.1

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
# SecRule &TX:wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled "@eq 0" \
#     "id:9507010,\
#     phase:1,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ver:'wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin/1.0.1',\
#     setvar:'tx.wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled=0'"
